# Vert - A Rusty Text Editor

Vert is a BLAZINGLY FAST text-editor built using Rust and TypeScript (via Tauri), designed to be easy to use, without much configuration. This public repo is where all development takes place. It also contains Roadmaps, Issues, Project board and the Wiki.

## Features (WIP)

Git Integration: Vert comes with built-in Git integration, making version control a breeze. You can initialize a Git repository for your projects directly from the application. Easily commit changes, view file diffs, and manage branches without leaving Vert.

Customizable Themes: Personalize your editing experience with a wide range of themes and color schemes. Choose the one that suits your preferences and reduces eye strain during long coding sessions.

Extensions Support: Extend the functionality of Vert with community-developed extensions. Install and manage extensions to tailor Vert according to your specific requirements.

Multi-Platform Support: Vert is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring you can use it on your favorite operating system.
