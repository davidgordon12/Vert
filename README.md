# <p align="center"> Vert - A Rusty Text Editor </p>

Vert is a BLAZINGLY FAST text-editor built using Rust and TypeScript (via Tauri), designed to be easy to use, without much configuration. This public repo is where all development takes place. It also contains Roadmaps, <a href="">Issues</a>, <a href="">Project board</a> and the <a href="">Wiki</a>.

## Features (WIP)

**Git Integration:** Vert comes with built-in Git integration, making version control a breeze. You can initialize a Git repository for your projects directly from the application. Easily commit changes, view file diffs, and manage branches without leaving Vert.

**Customizable Themes:** Personalize your editing experience with a wide range of themes and color schemes. Choose the one that suits your preferences and reduces eye strain during long coding sessions.

**Plugin Support:** Extend the functionality of Vert with community-developed plugins. Install and manage plugins to tailor Vert according to your needs.

**Multi-Platform Support:** Vert is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring you can use it on your favorite operating system.
